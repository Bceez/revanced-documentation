# **Troubleshooting**

## **No internet connection**

Re-login into Vanced MicroG or reinstall it.

## **How to use the ReVanced Manager**

You might likely be patching a split apk file, so refer to [Where to get full apk files](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/wiki/help/troubleshooting/#wiki_where_to_get_full_apk_files). You might be missing [Vanced MicroG](https://github.com/TeamVanced/VancedMicroG/releases). Install it. Otherwise, refer to [How to use the ReVanced Manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/wiki/help/troubleshooting/#wiki_how_to_use_the_revanced_manager) as well as [Can you support me?](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/wiki/help/questions/).
